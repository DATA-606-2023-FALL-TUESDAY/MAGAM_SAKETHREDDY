### 4-f Scatter plot for expected goals vs actual goals
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/saketh105/saketh105/blob/main/newplot%20(5).png" alt="Premier League Logo" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;">
</p>

##### Interpretation:
- Each point on the scatter plot represents a football team. The x-axis (expected goals, xG) measures the number of goals a team was expected to score based on various factors like the quality of scoring opportunities. The y-axis (actual goals, GF) measures the number of goals the team actually scored in matches. The size and color of the points may represent additional information, such as the total number of goals scored (size) and the team's identity (color).

##### Key observations from the visualization:
= By comparing the position of each point relative to the diagonal line (y = x), you can assess whether teams tend to score more or fewer goals than expected (above the line indicates scoring more goals than expected, and below indicates scoring fewer). The size of the points provides insights into the total goals scored, with larger points indicating more goals. The color differentiation helps identify different teams in the plot.

</p>

##### Interpretation:
- Each point on the scatter plot represents a football team. The x-axis (SOT) measures the number of shots on target, which indicates how many shots on goal were accurate and required a save from the opposing team's goalkeeper. The y-axis (GF) measures the number of goals the team actually scored in matches. The size and color of the points may represent additional information, such as the total number of goals scored (size) and the team's identity (color).

##### Key observations from the visualization:
- By comparing the position of each point relative to the diagonal line (y = x), you can assess the relationship between the number of shots on target and the number of goals scored. The size of the points provides insights into the total goals scored, with larger points indicating more goals. The color differentiation helps identify different teams in the plot.

</p>

##### Interpretation:
- The pie chart represents the distribution of wins among different football teams. Each slice of the pie corresponds to a specific team. The size of each slice is proportional to the number of wins achieved by the corresponding team. Inside each slice, the percentage and label indicate the percentage of total wins that the team has achieved.

##### Key observations from the pie chart:
- It provides a quick and intuitive overview of the distribution of wins among the teams. You can easily identify which team has the highest number of wins by comparing the sizes of the slices. The percentage and label inside each slice provide precise information about the portion of total wins for each team.

</p>

##### Interpretation:
- The sunburst chart is organized hierarchically, with outer rings representing seasons, inner rings representing teams, and the final ring indicating the number of goals scored. Each season is represented by an outer ring segment. Within each season segment, there are team segments, each corresponding to a specific football team. The color of the team segments indicates the number of games won by that team. The darker the color, the more games won. The size of each segment (season, team, and goals scored) is proportional to the value being visualized.

##### Key observations from the sunburst chart:
- The chart provides a hierarchical view of the data, allowing you to explore the number of goals scored and games won by each team in different seasons. By selecting a specific season or team segment, you can focus on the data for that particular category. The color-coded games won information allows for a quick visual comparison of team performance in terms of wins across different seasons.

</p>

##### Interpretation:

- The violin plot displays the distribution of possession data for various teams.
- Each "violin" represents a different team and provides information about the spread and central tendency of possession for that team.
-  The width of each violin indicates the density of data points at different possession levels. Wider sections represent higher data density, while narrower sections represent lower data density.
- The horizontal line inside each violin represents the median possession value for the respective team.
- The "box" aspect of the plot displays summary statistics, including the quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) of the possession data for each team.
- Violin plots are particularly useful for comparing the distribution of a continuous variable (possession) across different categories (teams).

#### Key observations from the violin plot:

- The violin plot allows you to compare the distribution of possession for various teams.
- Teams with wider and taller violins have possession values spread over a broader range, indicating more variability in possession percentages.
- Teams with higher median lines tend to have higher median possession percentages.
- The "box" portion of each violin provides a quick summary of the quartiles of possession data.

### 4-k Line graph for Goal Difference Over Seasons
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/saketh105/saketh105/blob/main/newplot%20(11).png" alt="Premier League Logo" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;">
</p>

##### Interpretation:
- The line chart shows the trend in goal difference for multiple football teams across different seasons. 
The x-axis represents the seasons, and the y-axis represents the goal difference. 
Each line in the chart corresponds to a specific football team, with different colors differentiating between teams.
The chart's title is "Goal Difference Over Seasons," and the label "Team" is used for the legend.

##### Key observations from the line chart:
- The chart provides a visual representation of how each team's goal difference has evolved over different seasons. Upward-sloping lines indicate seasons where the team had a positive goal difference (scored more goals than conceded), indicating strong performance in those seasons. Downward-sloping lines represent seasons where the team had a negative goal difference (conceded more goals than scored), suggesting a less successful performance in those seasons. Flat or nearly flat lines suggest that the team's goal difference remained relatively stable over multiple seasons.
